ShoppingMart-Ecommerce: MERN Stack E-commerce Web Application with User and Admin Functionalities

Brief: I developed a full-stack e-commerce web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, featuring a comprehensive set of functionalities for both users and administrators. The project encompasses user authentication, user and admin dashboards, product browsing with filters, cart management, order processing, and more.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - Implemented secure user registration, login, and forgot password functionality.
   - Utilized JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and session management.

2. User Dashboard:
   - Provided users with a personalized dashboard to manage their profile and view order history.
   - Enabled users to update their addresses for smooth order processing.

3. Homepage and Product Display:
   - Designed an intuitive homepage displaying various product categories.
   - Integrated a filtering mechanism to enable users to sort products by category and price.

4. Cart Management:
   - Enabled users to add and remove products to/from their shopping cart.
   - Calculated the total cart value dynamically.

5. Secure Payment Processing:
   - Integrated a secure payment gateway to facilitate seamless and safe transactions.
   - Supported multiple payment methods for user convenience.

6. Admin Functionalities:
   - Admins were granted special privileges to manage the platform.
   - Admin dashboard included functionalities to add, remove, or modify product categories and products.

7. Order Management:
   - Admins could view and change the status of orders (e.g., processing, canceled, delivered).
   - Status changes were immediately reflected on the user's end.

Technical Stack:

- Frontend: Developed using React.js to ensure a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Backend: Created a RESTful API with Node.js and Express.js for smooth communication between the frontend and database.
- Database: MongoDB used for data storage due to its flexibility and scalability.
- Authentication: Employed JWT for secure user authentication and session management.

Outcome:

By developing this MERN stack e-commerce project, I acquired practical experience in building robust and scalable web applications. This project showcases my expertise in frontend development with React.js, backend development with Node.js and Express.js, and database management using MongoDB. Moreover, it highlights my ability to implement user authentication, dynamic product filtering, cart management, secure payment processing, and admin functionalities for efficient platform management.
